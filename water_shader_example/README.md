# Water Shader Example

Run `python main.py` from this folder with Arcade installed. Drop a `water.png` texture next to `main.py` (any tiling blue texture works). The script loads `water.vert` and `water.frag`, feeds uniforms (`u_time`, `u_resolution`), and draws a fullscreen quad to show the wavy distortion.
